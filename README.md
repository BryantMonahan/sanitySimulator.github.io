This is meant to be a guide for those wanting to learn the basics of personal finance. This site's name is currently undecided as Mooka Money 
is way too expensive to buy the domain name for. A main focus of this website is to be visually pleasing and for users to enjoy playing around with
the graphs/calculators in hopes that they gain some interest and pursue more information outside of sanitySimulator.
