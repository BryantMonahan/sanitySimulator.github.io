        <h3>What is an Auto Loan?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>An auto loan is a type of loan used to purchase a vehicle that a borrower can't afford to buy outright.
            This loan allows the borrower to pay an up-front portion (usually around 20%) to the lender and the lender
            provides the remaining portion of the cost to the seller.
            <br><br>
            In exchange for providing the rest of the cost,
            the buyer will repay the lender over a period of time (anywhere from 24 to 84 months) while paying interest
            on the amount of money owed to the lender.
        </p>

        <h3>Why You Should Care</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>For example, an average new car loan with a loan amount of $40,000 and an average interest rate of 7.2% over
            69 months could result in almost $9,000 in interest paid over the life of the loan.
            This is a significant amount of money that could be used for other purposes, such as saving for retirement
            or paying off other debts.
            <br><br>
            By understanding the costs associated with auto loans, borrowers can make more informed decisions about
            their financing options and potentially save money in the long run.

        <h3>Deprecation</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Deprecation is the decrease in value of a vehicle over time. It is important to consider depreciation when
            purchasing a car, as it can significantly impact the overall cost of ownership.
            <br><br>
            On average, a new car loses about 20% of its value in the first year and about 15% each subsequent year.
            It's important for potential buyers to understand that vehicles are not investments and will cost money to
            maintain while losing value over time.
            <br><br>
            However, depreciation can be used in a buyer's advantage if they wait to buy a car until it is a few years
            old, as the price will be significantly lower than the original MSRP.
            For example, a car that costs $40,000 new may be available for around $25,000 after three years.
