        <h3>Saving</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Knowing how to save money is necessary to achieve financial security and independence. Building a healthy
            savings account protects you from unexpected expenses such as medical emergencies, car repairs, or even job
            loss. Furthermore, saving allows you to minimize or even eliminate high-interest debt on larger purchases
            such as cars.
            <br><br>
            If you're starting with nothing, building an emergency fund is your top priority. An emergency fund is meant
            to safety net to protect you from unexpected expenses. It's typically recommended to put away 3-6 months
            worth of expenses into an emergency fund. So, if your monthly expenses are $4,000 you should aim to save
            between $12,000 and $24,000.
            <br><br>
            After building an emergency fund, your excess income should be used to pay off debt, starting with the
            highest interest rate first. However, if given the choice between paying towards a debt with 3% APR and
            investing into an account with 5% APY, it may be better to invest your money as you would gain more through
            investment than you would pay in interest.
            <br><br>
            The 50/30/20 rule isn't so much a rule as it is a general go-to budgeting guideline. The idea is that
            you should spend 50% of your income on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings or paying back debt. However,
            it is important to remember that this is just a guideline and you should adjust it to fit your own financial
            situation.

        <h3>Simple vs Compound Interest</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>When saving money, it's important to know your APY. APY is the total amount of interest you'll earn on a
            savings or investment account, taking compounding into account. There are two types of interest: simple and
            compound.
            <br><br>
            Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, while compound interest is calculated on the
            principal and any interest added to the account. This allows compound interest to grow much quicker,
            especially over long periods of time.
            <br><br>
            I strongly encourage you to play around with the calculator below to see the difference between simple and
            compounding interest.

            <h3>Inflation</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Another factor to take into account when saving money is inflation. Inflation is the rate at which
                prices for goods and services rise, which subsequently decreases the value of your money. This generally
                averages out to around 3% per year, but can vary based on the economy.
                <br><br>
                If your APY is lower than the inflation rate, you are losing money over time. The average savings rate
                is around .41% APY which is significantly lower than the average inflation rate. To avoid loss, invest
                into a high-yield savings account or a money market account which may offer APYs of 4% or higher.
                <br><br>
                These accounts are typically offered by online banks and credit unions, and they can help you
                keep up with inflation while still earning interest on your savings. A simple Google search can find you
                a banks (insured by the FDIC) that offer high-yield savings accounts with competitive APYs.

            <h3>Banks vs Credit Unions</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Banks and credit unions are both financial institutions that offer similar services, such as checking and
                savings accounts,
                loans, and credit cards. However, there are some key differences between the two.
                <br><br>
                Banks are for-profit institutions that are owned by shareholders, while credit unions are non-profit
                organizations that
                are owned by their members. This means that credit unions typically offer lower fees and better interest
                rates than banks.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, some credit unions have membership requirements, such as living in a certain area or
                working
                for a specific employer.
                This can make it more difficult to join a credit union than a bank.
                <br><br>
                If you're looking for a new bank or credit union, I recommend doing some research to find one that fits
                your
                needs.
                You can use websites like Bankrate or NerdWallet to compare rates and fees.

            <h3>What does FDIC insured mean?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>The FDIC is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, an independent agency of the United States
                government
                that provides
                deposit insurance to depositors in U.S. commercial banks and savings institutions.
                <br><br>
                This means that if your bank fails, the FDIC will reimburse you for your deposits up to $250,000 per
                depositor, per insured bank.
                This insurance is funded by premiums paid by banks and savings institutions, not taxpayers.
                <br><br>
                It's important to note that not all financial institutions are FDIC insured. Be sure to check if your
                bank
                or credit union is
                insured before opening an account.
